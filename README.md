# SlowLetterBox

In Santa Village, there is an interesting mailbox where you can get letters on Christmas if you put them in. I took an idea from this and created a <strong>Slow Letter Box</strong>.<br />
You can send the letter on any date you want. However, the date will be at least <strong>a month after</strong>. <br />
This is a <strong>Slow Letter Box</strong>.
